# Shared pieces

- [Proof Context Release](release-gate/README.md) promotes Line 4's Release Gate unchanged and joins it to the Line 3/4 proof-backed call decoder. Exact call, complete fresh rehearsal set and same-block code context must all agree before one unsigned simulation context and its decoded return are released. Includes a new real ZTO code proof and balance call at block 26,188,942, replayable offline.

- [Fresh Set Surface Context](set-expiry/README.md) promotes Line 4's Set Expiry unchanged and gates the Line 3/4 proof-backed call-set decoder on an explicit review time and inclusive age window. Expired or unbound sets skip the proof join and withhold all decoded values. Real historical ZTO positive and expired demonstrations run offline.

- [Rehearsal Set and Set Surface Context](rehearsal-set/README.md) promotes Line 4's complete-set binder and joins it to Line 3's proof-backed selector inventory and Line 4's calldata/return decoders. Every planned member must bind and align before any joined decoded values are released. New relay provenance is validated and retained across the older decoder interface.

- [Surface Call Context](surface-return/CALL.md) adds Line 4's canonical calldata decoder to Line 3's proof-backed selector evidence and the existing return join. Its real ZTO `balanceOf(PoolManager)` demo checks arguments and returns at the same historical code-proof block. The explicit signature supplies argument types; mismatches withhold both decoded sides.

- [Contract Context](contract-context/README.md) joins Line 3's Code Lens and Line 4's Call Rehearsal. It checks that code identity and a simulated call concern the same target at the same block. Line 2 can use this before investigating a spender; Line 1 can use it when adding router/quoter execution checks.
- [Wall thumbnail](wall-thumbnail/README.md) promotes Line 4's standard-library PNG-to-JPEG helper for any wall. It has explicit input/output paths and refuses to overwrite an existing JPEG.
- [Change Context](change-context/README.md) joins Line 3's Code Changes and Line 4's Call Changes reports by target and exact endpoint blocks. Its real ZTO demo exposes a 32-block mismatch at both endpoints instead of implying a same-block comparison.

These are ordinary Python source files and real historical observations, with no third-party runtime dependency. Run from the workspace root with Python 3.10+ and `-B`. Originals in the line folders remain unchanged. Provenance and limits are documented beside each piece.

- [Witness Context](witness-context/README.md) promotes the newest code/opcode and two-provider call tools from Lines 3 and 4. It compares both providers' raw code identity and calls at one exact block, with a real aligned ZTO demonstration. An agreement is an evidence result, never permission to transact.

- [Revoke Rehearsal](revoke-rehearsal/README.md) promotes Line 2's unsigned approval drafts and Line 4's explicit return expectations. It checks the real observed owner, exact call and inventory block before accepting a saved boolean return. Its three real ZTO demonstrations replay offline.

- [Review Rehearsal Context](review-rehearsal-context/README.md) joins Line 3's reviewed code-identity result to Line 4's relay-capable call evidence. It refuses to combine reports unless the target and exact block agree and the code review itself accepted the identity.
- [Swap Code Context](swap-code-context/README.md) rechecks Line 1's ZTO/IMD swap review alongside Line 3's proved ZTO and IMD code set. It releases bounds only for an accepted, exact-block, exact-reference-height handoff; its real saved demonstration refuses mismatched historical evidence.

- [Permission Revert Context](permission-revert-context/README.md) joins Line 2's ZTO permission review to Line 4's exact rejected-call expectation. It checks that both inputs concern the same real ZTO target, without treating either historical report as authority to transact.

- [Surface Return Context](surface-return/README.md) promotes Line 3's proof-backed selector inventory and Line 4's canonical ABI return decoder as a portable folder. Its new real ZTO call at the proof's exact block aligns offline; a saved different-block call is refused. Return layouts remain explicit reviewer choices.

- [Rehearsal Binding](rehearsal-binding/README.md) promotes Line 4's exact call/evidence binder as a portable piece for Line 1 quoter checks and Line 2 unsigned approval rehearsals. Its ZTO `balanceOf(PoolManager)` demonstration binds only when caller, calldata, value, block, and raw return all agree.

- [Return Relations and Code Context](return-relations/README.md) promotes Line 4’s cross-call integer policy and joins it to Line 3’s same-block code evidence. Complete set, freshness, explicit layouts and every comparison must pass before any values are released. The real ZTO relation passes offline; the default bridge demo exposes different historical proof blocks and withholds all values.
